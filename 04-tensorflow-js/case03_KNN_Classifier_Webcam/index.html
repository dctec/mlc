      ""Now, let's make this more useful. We will make a custom 3-class object classifier using the webcam on the fly. We're going to make a classification through MobileNet, but this time we will take an internal representation (activation) of the model for a particular webcam image and use that for classification.

      We'll use a module called a "K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier", which effectively lets us put webcam images (actually, their MobileNet activations) into different categories (or "classes"), and when the user asks to make a prediction we simply choose the class that has the most similar activation to the one we are making a prediction for.

      Add an import of KNN Classifier to the end of the imports in the <head> tag of index.html (you will still need MobileNet, so don't remove that import):""
